# HuffmanCodingPy

HuffmanCodingPy is a Python-based project that demonstrates the use and implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm for file compression and decompression. Developed as part of a Computer Engineering degree's "Algorithm Design" course, this project showcases the efficiency of Huffman coding in reducing file size without loss of data.

## Features
- Efficient text file compression and decompression using Huffman coding
- Calculation and display of file sizes before and after compression to demonstrate efficiency
- Detailed Huffman tree construction for encoding and decoding processes

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/talshva/HuffmanCoding.git
cd HuffmanCodingPy

### Running the Program
To compress a text file, run:
'python compression.py <path_to_text_file>'

To decompress a previously compressed file, run:
'python decompression.py <path_to_compressed_file>'

### Compression Efficiency
The HuffmanCodingPy project aims to significantly reduce file sizes through compression. Below is an example for compressing a large text file, showing the effectiveness of the compression algorithm by comparing file sizes before and after compression:

Original File Size: TBD
Compressed File Size: TBD
Compression Ratio: TBD%
